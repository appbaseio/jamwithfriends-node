Note: It might take 10s to render the first screen because it fetches all the data for the frist time.

Play the [Jam with Friends](appbaseio.github.io/jam-with-friends) keys and see the console update the key count in realtime.

You can do everything with the [npm package of Appbase.JS](https://www.npmjs.org/package/appbasejs) that you can with the Javascript library. Have fun!
